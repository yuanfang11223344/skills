# Papers Search Skill

Search scientific papers using `scimesh` via `uvx` (no global installation required).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SCOPUS_API_KEY` | For Scopus | Elsevier API key (+ institutional VPN) |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | Optional | For higher rate limits on Semantic Scholar |
| `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` | For download | Email for Unpaywall API |

## Available Providers

| Provider | API Key | Notes | search | get | citations |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|-----|-----------|
| arXiv | No | Preprints | Y | Y | N |
| OpenAlex | No | 61M+ papers, largest open DB | Y | Y | Y |
| Scopus | `SCOPUS_API_KEY` | Requires institutional access | Y | Y | Y (in) |
| Semantic Scholar | Optional | 200M+ papers, citation graph | Y | Y | Y |

## Basic Usage

Execute commands directly with `uvx scimesh`:

```bash
# Search with field operators
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)"

# Plain text also works (searches in title AND abstract)
uvx scimesh search "transformers"
uvx scimesh search "attention mechanism"
```

## Triggers

- "search papers about X"
- "papers about Y"
- "I want to read about Z"
- "recent papers on W"
- "what's new in transformers?"
- "save this paper to workspace"

## Search Flow

1. **Understand the intent**: extract topic/query from user message
2. **Refine with questions** (use AskUserQuestion):
   - Year filter? (2024 / 2023-2024 / 2020-2024 / Run search)
   - Specific area? (ML / NLP / CV / Run search)
   - Preferred sources? (All / arXiv / OpenAlex / Run search)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Always include "Run search" as an option so the user can skip refinements
3. **Connectivity check** (BEFORE executing search):
   ```python
   {
       "questions": [
           {
               "question": "Are you connected to institutional VPN?",
               "header": "VPN",
               "options": [
                   {"label": "Yes, VPN active", "description": "Better access to papers"},
                   {"label": "No VPN", "description": "Will use Open Access only"},
                   {"label": "Wait, connecting...", "description": "Pause for VPN connection"}
               ],
               "multiSelect": False
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   - If user chooses "Wait", pause and ask again when ready
4. **Execute search using Scopus syntax**:
   ```bash
   uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer) AND PUBYEAR > 2020" -p arxiv,openalex -n 20
   ```
5. **Present results** in a readable format

## Full Paper Reading Flow

When the user wants to read a complete paper (fullpaper):

### 1. Pre-Download Check

**BEFORE downloading, ask about connectivity and Sci-Hub in a single batch:**

```python
{
    "questions": [
        {
            "question": "Are you connected to institutional VPN?",
            "header": "VPN",
            "options": [
                {"label": "Yes, VPN active", "description": "Institutional access enabled"},
                {"label": "No VPN", "description": "Will try Open Access only"},
                {"label": "Wait, connecting...", "description": "Pause for VPN connection"}
            ],
            "multiSelect": False
        },
        {
            "question": "Enable Sci-Hub as fallback if Open Access fails?",
            "header": "Sci-Hub",
            "options": [
                {"label": "No (Rec)", "description": "Only legal Open Access sources"},
                {"label": "Yes", "description": "Use --scihub flag (at your own risk)"}
            ],
            "multiSelect": False
        }
    ]
}
```

- If user chooses "Wait, connecting...", pause and ask again when ready
- If user enables Sci-Hub, add `--scihub` flag to download commands

### 2. Download the PDF

Use the scimesh `download` command (requires `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL`):

```bash
# Download via DOI (tries Open Access via Unpaywall)
uvx scimesh download "10.1234/example" -o {papers_dir}/

# With Sci-Hub fallback (use at your own risk)
uvx scimesh download "10.1234/example" --scihub -o {papers_dir}/

# Download multiple DOIs from file
uvx scimesh download -f dois.txt -o {papers_dir}/

# Search + Download directly (pipe)
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(paper)" -f json | uvx scimesh download -o {papers_dir}/

# For arXiv papers, use DOI in the format: 10.48550/arXiv.XXXX.XXXXX
```

**PDF Caching**: PDFs are automatically cached in `~/.scimesh/cache/pdfs/` - avoids re-download.

Manual alternatives:
- **arXiv**: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/XXXX.XXXXX`
- **Generic DOI**: Check the `pdf_url` field in search results

### 3. Folder Structure

Ask user where to save papers (if not already configured):

```python
{
    "question": "Where should I save papers?",
    "header": "Papers dir",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Current directory", "description": "./papers/"},
        {"label": "Documents", "description": "~/Documents/papers/"},
        {"label": "Custom path", "description": "You specify"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": False
}
```

Save in `{papers_dir}/` with the structure:

```
{papers_dir}/
  <year>-<first-author>-<short-title>/
    fulltext.pdf
    README.md
```

**Note:** `{papers_dir}` is user-defined. Examples: `./papers/`, `~/Documents/papers/`, `~/brain/08-papers/`

Example: `2024-wang-treb/`

### 4. Read the PDF

- Use `Read` tool directly on the `.pdf` file (native Claude Code support)
- **No need** for `pdftotext`, `PyMuPDF`, or other Python libs
- Claude Code extracts text + renders figures page by page

### 5. Systematic Reading Structure

1. **Abstract** - understand the main claim
2. **Figures/Tables** - often tell the story before the text
3. **Methodology** - how they did it
4. **Results** - specific metrics, comparisons with baselines
5. **Limitations** - what the authors admit (or omit)

### 6. Critical Verification Checklist

- [ ] Compares with relevant baselines?
- [ ] Uses standard metrics for the field?
- [ ] Tests on multiple datasets?
- [ ] Reports standard deviation/confidence intervals?
- [ ] Code available?
- [ ] Limitations section exists?

### 7. Common Red Flags

- Empty or superficial "Evaluation" sections
- Only one dataset
- Non-standard or invented metrics
- No quantitative comparison with existing methods
- Strong claims without proportional evidence

## Save Flow

When the user asks to save a paper:

1. Get complete details (use previous search result or search by DOI/arXiv ID)
2. Create paper folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p {papers_dir}/<year>-<author>-<title>/
   ```

3. Download PDF (if available):
   ```bash
   uvx scimesh download "DOI" -o {papers_dir}/<year>-<author>-<title>/
   ```

4. Create `README.md` in the folder with the format:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Paper Title"
   authors: [Author 1, Author 2]
   year: 2024
   doi: 10.1234/example
   arxiv: 2401.12345
   tags: [paper, area, subtopic]
   saved: YYYY-MM-DD

uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer) AND AUTHOR(Vaswani)"

# Filter by year
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(attention) AND PUBYEAR > 2020"
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(BERT) AND PUBYEAR = 2024"

# Search in abstract
uvx scimesh search "TITLE-ABS-KEY(reinforcement learning)"

# Fulltext search
uvx scimesh search "ALL(CRISPR gene editing)"

# Combine operators
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer) AND AUTHOR(Bengio) AND PUBYEAR > 2020"

# Negation
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(deep learning) AND NOT TITLE(survey)"

# Group conditions
uvx scimesh search "(TITLE(transformer) OR TITLE(attention)) AND PUBYEAR = 2024"
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Limit number of results per provider
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)" -n 20

# Limit total results
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)" -t 50

# Choose providers (arxiv, openalex, scopus, semantic_scholar)
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)" -p arxiv,openalex,semantic_scholar

uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)" -f json | uvx scimesh download -o papers/

# Disable deduplication
uvx scimesh search "TITLE(transformer)" --no-dedupe
```

### Local Indexing for Fulltext

For fulltext search on providers without native support (Semantic Scholar):

```bash
# Index local PDFs
uvx scimesh index ./papers/

# Clear and re-index
uvx scimesh index ./papers/ --clear

# Now ALL() uses local index + native APIs
uvx scimesh search "ALL(attention mechanism)"
```

The index is stored in `~/.scimesh/fulltext.db` using SQLite FTS5.
