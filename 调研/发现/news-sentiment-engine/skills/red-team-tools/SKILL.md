# Red Team Tools and Methodology

## Purpose

Implement proven methodologies and tool workflows from top security researchers for effective reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, and bug bounty hunting. Automate common tasks while maintaining thorough coverage of attack surfaces.

## Inputs/Prerequisites

- Target scope definition (domains, IP ranges, applications)
- Linux-based attack machine (Kali, Ubuntu)
- Bug bounty program rules and scope
- Tool dependencies installed (Go, Python, Ruby)
- API keys for various services (Shodan, Censys, etc.)

## Outputs/Deliverables

- Comprehensive subdomain enumeration
- Live host discovery and technology fingerprinting
- Identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Automated recon pipeline outputs
- Documented findings for reporting

## Core Workflow

### 1. Project Tracking and Acquisitions

Set up reconnaissance tracking:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p target/{recon,vulns,reports}
cd target

# Find acquisitions using Crunchbase
# Search manually for subsidiary companies

# Get ASN for targets
amass intel -org "Target Company" -src

# Alternative ASN lookup
curl -s "https://bgp.he.net/search?search=targetcompany&commit=Search"
```

### 2. Subdomain Enumeration

Comprehensive subdomain discovery:

```bash
# Create wildcards file
echo "target.com" > wildcards

# Run Amass passively
amass enum -passive -d target.com -src -o amass_passive.txt

# Run Amass actively
amass enum -active -d target.com -src -o amass_active.txt

# Use Subfinder
subfinder -d target.com -silent -o subfinder.txt

# Asset discovery
cat wildcards | assetfinder --subs-only | anew domains.txt

# Alternative subdomain tools
findomain -t target.com -o

# Generate permutations with dnsgen
cat domains.txt | dnsgen - | httprobe > permuted.txt

# Combine all sources
cat amass_*.txt subfinder.txt | sort -u > all_subs.txt
```

### 3. Live Host Discovery

Identify responding hosts:

```bash
# Check which hosts are live with httprobe
cat domains.txt | httprobe -c 80 --prefer-https | anew hosts.txt

# Use httpx for more details
cat domains.txt | httpx -title -tech-detect -status-code -o live_hosts.txt

# Alternative with massdns
massdns -r resolvers.txt -t A -o S domains.txt > resolved.txt
```

### 4. Technology Fingerprinting

Identify technologies for targeted attacks:

```bash
# Whatweb scanning
whatweb -i hosts.txt -a 3 -v > tech_stack.txt

# Nuclei technology detection
nuclei -l hosts.txt -t technologies/ -o tech_nuclei.txt

# Wappalyzer (if available)
# Browser extension for manual review
```

### 5. Content Discovery

Find hidden endpoints and files:

```bash
# Directory bruteforce with ffuf
ffuf -ac -v -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt

# Historical URLs from Wayback
waybackurls target.com | tee wayback.txt

# Find all URLs with gau
gau target.com | tee all_urls.txt

# Parameter discovery
cat all_urls.txt | grep "=" | sort -u > params.txt

# Generate custom wordlist from historical data
cat all_urls.txt | unfurl paths | sort -u > custom_wordlist.txt
```

### 6. Application Analysis (Jason Haddix Method)

**Heat Map Priority Areas:**

1. **File Uploads** - Test for injection, XXE, SSRF, shell upload
2. **Content Types** - Filter Burp for multipart forms
3. **APIs** - Look for hidden methods, lack of auth
4. **Profile Sections** - Stored XSS, custom fields
5. **Integrations** - SSRF through third parties
6. **Error Pages** - Exotic injection points

**Analysis Questions:**
- How does the app pass data? (Params, API, Hybrid)
- Where does the app talk about users? (UID, UUID endpoints)
- Does the site have multi-tenancy or user levels?
- Does it have a unique threat model?
- How does the site handle XSS/CSRF?
- Has the site had past writeups/exploits?

### 7. Automated XSS Hunting

```bash
# ParamSpider for parameter extraction
python3 paramspider.py --domain target.com -o params.txt

# Filter with Gxss
cat params.txt | Gxss -p test

# Dalfox for XSS testing
cat params.txt | dalfox pipe --mining-dict params.txt -o xss_results.txt

# Alternative workflow
waybackurls target.com | grep "=" | qsreplace '"><script>alert(1)</script>' | while read url; do
    curl -s "$url" | grep -q 'alert(1)' && echo "$url"
done > potential_xss.txt
```

### 8. Vulnerability Scanning

```bash
# Nuclei comprehensive scan
nuclei -l hosts.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/ -o nuclei_results.txt

# Check for common CVEs
nuclei -l hosts.txt -t cves/ -o cve_results.txt

# Web vulnerabilities
nuclei -l hosts.txt -t vulnerabilities/ -o vuln_results.txt
```

### 9. API Enumeration

**Wordlists for API fuzzing:**

```bash
# Enumerate API endpoints
ffuf -u https://target.com/api/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/api/api-endpoints.txt

# Test API versions
ffuf -u https://target.com/api/v1/FUZZ -w api_wordlist.txt
ffuf -u https://target.com/api/v2/FUZZ -w api_wordlist.txt

# Check for hidden methods
for method in GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH; do
    cu
