# Deploy to Vercel

Deploy any project to Vercel. **Always deploy as preview** (not production) unless the user explicitly asks for production.

The goal is to get the user into the best long-term setup: their project linked to Vercel with git-push deploys. Every method below tries to move the user closer to that state.

## When to Use
- Use this skill when the task matches this description: Deploy applications and websites to Vercel. Use when the user requests deployment actions like "deploy my app", "deploy and give me the link", "push this live", or "create a preview deployment".

## Step 1: Gather Project State

Run all four checks before deciding which method to use:

```bash
# 1. Check for a git remote
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null

# 2. Check if locally linked to a Vercel project (either file means linked)
cat .vercel/project.json 2>/dev/null || cat .vercel/repo.json 2>/dev/null

# 3. Check if the Vercel CLI is installed and authenticated
vercel whoami 2>/dev/null

# 4. List available teams (if authenticated)
vercel teams list --format json 2>/dev/null
```

### Team selection

If the user belongs to multiple teams, present all available team slugs as a bulleted list and ask which one to deploy to. Once the user picks a team, proceed immediately to the next step — do not ask for additional confirmation.

Pass the team slug via `--scope` on all subsequent CLI commands (`vercel deploy`, `vercel link`, `vercel inspect`, etc.):

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait --scope <team-slug>
```

If the project is already linked (`.vercel/project.json` or `.vercel/repo.json` exists), the `orgId` in those files determines the team — no need to ask again. If there is only one team (or just a personal account), skip the prompt and use it directly.

**About the `.vercel/` directory:** A linked project has either:
- `.vercel/project.json` — created by `vercel link` (single project linking). Contains `projectId` and `orgId`.
- `.vercel/repo.json` — created by `vercel link --repo` (repo-based linking). Contains `orgId`, `remoteName`, and a `projects` array mapping directories to Vercel project IDs.

Either file means the project is linked. Check for both.

**Do NOT** use `vercel project inspect`, `vercel ls`, or `vercel link` to detect state in an unlinked directory — without a `.vercel/` config, they will interactively prompt (or with `--yes`, silently link as a side-effect). Only `vercel whoami` is safe to run anywhere.

## Step 2: Choose a Deploy Method

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + has git remote → Git Push

This is the ideal state. The project is linked and has git integration.

1. **Ask the user before pushing.** Never push without explicit approval:
   ```
   This project is connected to Vercel via git. I can commit and push to
   trigger a deployment. Want me to proceed?
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "deploy: <description of changes>"
   git push
   ```
   Vercel automatically builds from the push. Non-production branches get preview deployments; the production branch (usually `main`) gets a production deployment.

3. **Retrieve the preview URL.** If the CLI is authenticated:
   ```bash
   sleep 5
   vercel ls --format json
   ```
   The JSON output has a `deployments` array. Find the latest entry — its `url` field is the preview URL.

   If the CLI is not authenticated, tell the user to check the Vercel dashboard or the commit status checks on their git provider for the preview URL.

### Linked (`.vercel/` exists) + no git remote → `vercel deploy`

The project is linked but there's no git repo. Deploy directly with the CLI.

```bash
vercel deploy [path] -y --no-wait
```

Use `--no-wait` so the CLI returns immediately with the deployment URL instead of blocking until the build finishes (builds can take a while). Then check on the deployment status with:

```bash
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

For production deploys (only if user explicitly asks):
```bash
vercel deploy [path] --prod -y --no-wait
```

---

### Not linked + CLI is authenticated → Link first, then deploy

The CLI is working but the project isn't linked yet. This is the opportunity to get the user into the best state.

1. **Ask the user which team to deploy to.** Present the team slugs from Step 1 as a bulleted list. If there's only one team (or just a personal account), skip this step.

2. **Once a team is selected, proceed directly to linking.** Tell the user what will happen but do not ask for separate confirmation:
   ```
   Linking this project to <team name> on Vercel. This will create a Vercel
   project to deploy to and enable automatic deployments on future git pushes.
   ```

3. **If a git remote exists**, use repo-based linking with the selected team scope:
   ```bash
   vercel link --repo --scope <team-slug>
   ```
   This reads the git remote URL and matches it to existing Vercel projects that deploy from that repo. It creates `.vercel/repo.json`. This is much more
