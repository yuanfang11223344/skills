# Wiki Changelog

Generate structured changelogs from git history.

## When to Activate

- User asks "what changed recently", "generate a changelog", "summarize commits"
- User wants to understand recent development activity

## Procedure

1. Examine git log (commits, dates, authors, messages)
2. Group by time period: daily (last 7 days), weekly (older)
3. Classify each commit: Features (🆕), Fixes (🐛), Refactoring (🔄), Docs (📝), Config (🔧), Dependencies (📦), Breaking (⚠️)
4. Generate concise user-facing descriptions using project terminology

## Constraints

- Focus on user-facing changes
- Merge related commits into coherent descriptions
- Use project terminology from README
- Highlight breaking changes prominently with migration notes

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.
