## Capabilities

### Python SDK Implementation

**Worker Configuration and Startup**

- Worker initialization with proper task queue configuration
- Workflow and activity registration patterns
- Concurrent worker deployment strategies
- Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
- Connection pooling and retry configuration

**Workflow Implementation Patterns**

- Workflow definition with `@workflow.defn` decorator
- Async/await workflow entry points with `@workflow.run`
- Workflow-safe time operations with `workflow.now()`
- Deterministic workflow code patterns
- Signal and query handler implementation
- Child workflow orchestration
- Workflow continuation and completion strategies

**Activity Implementation**

- Activity definition with `@activity.defn` decorator
- Sync vs async activity execution models
- ThreadPoolExecutor for blocking I/O operations
- ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-intensive tasks
- Activity context and cancellation handling
- Heartbeat reporting for long-running activities
- Activity-specific error handling

### Async/Await and Execution Models

**Three Execution Patterns** (Source: docs.temporal.io):

1. **Async Activities** (asyncio)
   - Non-blocking I/O operations
   - Concurrent execution within worker
   - Use for: API calls, async database queries, async libraries

2. **Sync Multithreaded** (ThreadPoolExecutor)
   - Blocking I/O operations
   - Thread pool manages concurrency
   - Use for: sync database clients, file operations, legacy libraries

3. **Sync Multiprocess** (ProcessPoolExecutor)
   - CPU-intensive computations
   - Process isolation for parallel processing
   - Use for: data processing, heavy calculations, ML inference

**Critical Anti-Pattern**: Blocking the async event loop turns async programs into serial execution. Always use sync activities for blocking operations.

### Error Handling and Retry Policies

**ApplicationError Usage**

- Non-retryable errors with `non_retryable=True`
- Custom error types for business logic
- Dynamic retry delay with `next_retry_delay`
- Error message and context preservation

**RetryPolicy Configuration**

- Initial retry interval and backoff coefficient
- Maximum retry interval (cap exponential backoff)
- Maximum attempts (eventual failure)
- Non-retryable error types classification

**Activity Error Handling**

- Catching `ActivityError` in workflows
- Extracting error details and context
- Implementing compensation logic
- Distinguishing transient vs permanent failures

**Timeout Configuration**

- `schedule_to_close_timeout`: Total activity duration limit
- `start_to_close_timeout`: Single attempt duration
- `heartbeat_timeout`: Detect stalled activities
- `schedule_to_start_timeout`: Queuing time limit

### Signal and Query Patterns

**Signals** (External Events)

- Signal handler implementation with `@workflow.signal`
- Async signal processing within workflow
- Signal validation and idempotency
- Multiple signal handlers per workflow
- External workflow interaction patterns

**Queries** (State Inspection)

- Query handler implementation with `@workflow.query`
- Read-only workflow state access
- Query performance optimization
- Consistent snapshot guarantees
- External monitoring and debugging

**Dynamic Handlers**

- Runtime signal/query registration
- Generic handler patterns
- Workflow introspection capabilities

### State Management and Determinism

**Deterministic Coding Requirements**

- Use `workflow.now()` instead of `datetime.now()`
- Use `workflow.random()` instead of `random.random()`
- No threading, locks, or global state
- No direct external calls (use activities)
- Pure functions and deterministic logic only

**State Persistence**

- Automatic workflow state preservation
- Event history replay mechanism
- Workflow versioning with `workflow.get_version()`
- Safe code evolution strategies
- Backward compatibility patterns

**Workflow Variables**

- Workflow-scoped variable persistence
- Signal-based state updates
- Query-based state inspection
- Mutab
