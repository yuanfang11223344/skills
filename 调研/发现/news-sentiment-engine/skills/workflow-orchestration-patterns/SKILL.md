# Workflow Orchestration Patterns

Master workflow orchestration architecture with Temporal, covering fundamental design decisions, resilience patterns, and best practices for building reliable distributed systems.

## Use this skill when

- Working on workflow orchestration patterns tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for workflow orchestration patterns

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to workflow orchestration patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## When to Use Workflow Orchestration

### Ideal Use Cases (Source: docs.temporal.io)

- **Multi-step processes** spanning machines/services/databases
- **Distributed transactions** requiring all-or-nothing semantics
- **Long-running workflows** (hours to years) with automatic state persistence
- **Failure recovery** that must resume from last successful step
- **Business processes**: bookings, orders, campaigns, approvals
- **Entity lifecycle management**: inventory tracking, account management, cart workflows
- **Infrastructure automation**: CI/CD pipelines, provisioning, deployments
- **Human-in-the-loop** systems requiring timeouts and escalations

### When NOT to Use

- Simple CRUD operations (use direct API calls)
- Pure data processing pipelines (use Airflow, batch processing)
- Stateless request/response (use standard APIs)
- Real-time streaming (use Kafka, event processors)

## Critical Design Decision: Workflows vs Activities

**The Fundamental Rule** (Source: temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles):

- **Workflows** = Orchestration logic and decision-making
- **Activities** = External interactions (APIs, databases, network calls)

### Workflows (Orchestration)

**Characteristics:**

- Contain business logic and coordination
- **MUST be deterministic** (same inputs → same outputs)
- **Cannot** perform direct external calls
- State automatically preserved across failures
- Can run for years despite infrastructure failures

**Example workflow tasks:**

- Decide which steps to execute
- Handle compensation logic
- Manage timeouts and retries
- Coordinate child workflows

### Activities (External Interactions)

**Characteristics:**

- Handle all external system interactions
- Can be non-deterministic (API calls, DB writes)
- Include built-in timeouts and retry logic
- **Must be idempotent** (calling N times = calling once)
- Short-lived (seconds to minutes typically)

**Example activity tasks:**

- Call payment gateway API
- Write to database
- Send emails or notifications
- Query external services

### Design Decision Framework

```
Does it touch external systems? → Activity
Is it orchestration/decision logic? → Workflow
```

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Saga Pattern with Compensation

**Purpose**: Implement distributed transactions with rollback capability

**Pattern** (Source: temporal.io/blog/compensating-actions-part-of-a-complete-breakfast-with-sagas):

```
For each step:
  1. Register compensation BEFORE executing
  2. Execute the step (via activity)
  3. On failure, run all compensations in reverse order (LIFO)
```

**Example: Payment Workflow**

1. Reserve inventory (compensation: release inventory)
2. Charge payment (compensation: refund payment)
3. Fulfill order (compensation: cancel fulfillment)

**Critical Requirements:**

- Compensations must be idempotent
- Register compensation BEFORE executing step
- Run compensations in reverse order
- Handle partial failures gracefully

### 2. Entity Workflows (Actor Model)

**Purpose**: Long-lived workflow representing single entity instance

**Pattern** (Source: docs.temporal.io/evaluate/use-cases-design-patterns):

- One workflow execution = one entity (cart, account, inventory item)
- Workflow persists for entity lifetime
- Receives signals for state changes
- Supports queries for current state

**Example Use Cases:**

- Shopping cart (add items, checkout, expiration)
- Bank account (deposits, withdrawals, balance checks)
- Product inventory (stock updates, reservations)

**Benefits:**

- Encapsulates entity behavior
- Guarantees consistency per entity
- Natural event sourcing

### 3. Fan-Out/Fan-In (Parallel Execution)

**Purpose**: Execute multiple tasks in parallel, aggregate results

**Pattern:**

- Spawn child workflows or parallel activities
- Wait for all to complete
- Aggregate results
- Handle partial failures

**Scaling Rule** (Source: temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles):

- Don't scale individual workflows
- For 1M tasks: spawn 1K child workflows × 1K tasks each
- Keep each workflow bounded

### 4. Async Callback Pattern

**Purpose**: Wait for external event or human approval

**Pattern:**

- Workflow sends request and waits for signal
- Ex
