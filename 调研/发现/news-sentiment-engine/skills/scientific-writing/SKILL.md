# Scientific Writing

## Overview

**This is the core skill for the deep research and writing tool**—combining AI-driven deep research with well-formatted written outputs. Every document produced is backed by comprehensive literature search and verified citations through the research-lookup skill.

Scientific writing is a process for communicating research with precision and clarity. Write manuscripts using IMRAD structure, citations (APA/AMA/Vancouver), figures/tables, and reporting guidelines (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA). Apply this skill for research papers and journal submissions.

**Critical Principle: Always write in full paragraphs with flowing prose. Never submit bullet points in the final manuscript.** Use a two-stage process: first create section outlines with key points using research-lookup, then convert those outlines into complete paragraphs.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Writing or revising any section of a scientific manuscript (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion)
- Structuring a research paper using IMRAD or other standard formats
- Formatting citations and references in specific styles (APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE)
- Creating, formatting, or improving figures, tables, and data visualizations
- Applying study-specific reporting guidelines (CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for reviews)
- Drafting abstracts that meet journal requirements (structured or unstructured)
- Preparing manuscripts for submission to specific journals
- Improving writing clarity, conciseness, and precision
- Ensuring proper use of field-specific terminology and nomenclature
- Addressing reviewer comments and revising manuscripts

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Every scientific paper MUST include a graphical abstract plus 1-2 additional AI-generated figures using the scientific-schematics skill.**

This is not optional. Scientific papers without visual elements are incomplete. Before finalizing any document:
1. **ALWAYS generate a graphical abstract** as the first visual element
2. Generate at minimum ONE additional schematic or diagram using scientific-schematics
3. Prefer 3-4 total figures for comprehensive papers (graphical abstract + methods flowchart + results visualization + conceptual diagram)

### Graphical Abstract (REQUIRED)

**Every scientific writeup MUST include a graphical abstract.** This is a visual summary of your paper that:
- Appears before or immediately after the text abstract
- Captures the entire paper's key message in one image
- Is suitable for journal table of contents display
- Uses landscape orientation (typically 1200x600px)

**Generate the graphical abstract FIRST:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "Graphical abstract for [paper title]: [brief description showing workflow from input → methods → key findings → conclusions]" -o figures/graphical_abstract.png
```

**Graphical Abstract Requirements:**
- **Content**: Visual summary showing workflow, key methods, main findings, and conclusions
- **Style**: Clean, professional, suitable for journal TOC
- **Elements**: Include 3-5 key steps/concepts with connecting arrows or flow
- **Text**: Minimal labels, large readable fonts
- Log: `[HH:MM:SS] GENERATED: Graphical abstract for paper summary`

### Additional Figures (GENERATE EXTENSIVELY)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use BOTH scientific-schematics AND generate-image EXTENSIVELY throughout all documents.**

Every document should be richly illustrated. Generate figures liberally - when in doubt, add a visual.

**MINIMUM Figure Requirements:**

| Document Type | Minimum | Recommended |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Research Papers | 5 | 6-8 |
| Literature Reviews | 4 | 5-7 |
| Market Research | 20 | 25-30 |
| Presentations | 1/slide | 1-2/slide |
| Posters | 6 | 8-10 |
| Grants | 4 | 5-7 |
| Clinical Reports | 3 | 4-6 |

**Use scientific-schematics EXTENSIVELY for technical diagrams:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

- Study design and methodology flowcharts (CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE)
- Conceptual framework diagrams
- Experimental workflow illustrations
- Data analysis pipeline diagrams
- Biological pathway or mechanism diagrams
- System architecture visualizations
- Neural network architectures
- Decision trees, algorithm flowcharts
- Comparison matrices, timeline diagrams
- Any technical concept that benefits from schematic visualization

**Use generate-image EXTENSIVELY for visual content:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_image.py "your image description" -o figures/output.png
```

- Photorealistic illustrations of concepts
- Medical/anatomical illustrations
- Environmental/ecological scenes
- Equipment and lab setup visualizations
- Artistic visualizations, infographics
- Cover images, header graphics
- Product mockups, prototype visualizations
- Any visual that enhances understanding or engagement
